# The Strength of Low-Cloud Feedbacks and Tropical Climate: A CESM Sensitivity Study (project ended in 2019).

### Descriptions:
This project is a global climate modeling at GMU to study the sensitivity of low cloud feedback as a function of global sea surface temperature (SST). If you are interested in reproducing the model outputs, contact the author.

### Author:
- Ehsan Erfani

### Codes:
- Numerous MATLAB codes were developed for post-processing, visualization, and various statistical analysis. 

### Inputs:
- CESM outputs in NetCDF format.
- Observational and reanalysis data files in NetCDF format.

### Requirements:
- MATLAB

### The analyses are featured in:
